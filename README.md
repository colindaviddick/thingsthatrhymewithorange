# Getting Started with Create React App

This app generates a game, to be played alone or in a group.

The aim of the game is to fill in your form with as many answers as possible. Answer each category with a word beginning with the letter at the top of each column. Try to fill in every square.

Decide on a time limit before you start. 1-2 minutes is a good amount of time.

Every unique answer scores a point. Answers which are not unique do not count. Any discrepancies as to whether an answer counts are judged by all other players. Majority rules.
